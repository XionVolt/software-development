[React-router dom, and guide to setup the routing](https://youtu.be/lAFbKzO-fss?si=h_gto59SVxc8si9t&t=24047)

## What is Routing?
- **Routing** ***is the process of determining what to display to the user based on the URL they are trying to access***. It allows you to create a single-page application (SPA) that can dynamically change the content displayed without requiring a full page reload.

- **React Router** is basically a library that allows you to setup a routing and navigation for your app. It provides components and functions to manage the navigation state and render the appropriate components based on the current URL.

- Additionally, it supports nested routes, route parameters, and programmatic navigation, making it a powerful tool for building complex applications.
