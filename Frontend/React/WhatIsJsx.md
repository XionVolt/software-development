### What is JSX(JavaScript XML)?

JSX is an XML-like extension to the JavaScript language syntax, initially created by Facebook for use with React and later adopted by multiple web frameworks.

#### Key Features:
- Combines HTML and JavaScript in a single syntax.
- Allows developers to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript(***components***).
- Simplifies the creation of dynamic user interfaces by embedding JavaScript expressions and managing event handling.

#### How It Works:
- JSX is generally transpiled into nested JavaScript function calls structurally similar to the original JSX.
- It is recommended for describing what the UI should look like in React applications.

#### Benefits:
- Enables writing HTML in React, making the code more readable and maintainable.
- Facilitates seamless integration of JavaScript logic within UI components.
- Enhances developer productivity by reducing context switching between HTML and JavaScript.
