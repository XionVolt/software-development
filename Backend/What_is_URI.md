# Understanding URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)

A **Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)** is a unique sequence of characters that identifies an abstract digital or physical resource. These resources can include:

- Webpage resources
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Books
- Real-world objects like people and places
- Concepts

URIs are also used to identify anything described using the **Resource Description Framework (RDF)**. For example:

- Concepts that are part of an ontology defined using the **Web Ontology Language (OWL)**
- People described using the **Friend of a Friend (FOAF)** vocabulary

## URI vs URL

Although often used interchangeably, **URI** and **URL** are different:

- A **URI** is an identifier of a specific resource.
- A **URL** is a special type of URI that identifies a resource and specifies how it can be accessed.

### Key Differences:

- A URI can identify and differentiate various types of files and resources (e.g., HTML, XML).
- A URL is specifically used to identify and locate webpages and resources.

### Relationship Between URI and URL:

- URIs that provide a means of locating and retrieving information resources on a network (e.g., the Internet, a private network, or a filesystem or intranet) are called **Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)**.
- Therefore, **URLs are a subset of URIs**, meaning every URL is a URI, but not every URI is a URL.
