- **Hop in Networking Context**: In networking, a "hop" refers to a step in the journey of a data packet from its source to its destination. Each hop represents a point where the packet is received, processed, and then forwarded to the next hop. For example, in a network, a data packet might travel from a sender's computer to a router, then to another router, and finally to the receiver's computer, with each leg of the journey counting as a hop.

    - **Data Packet**: A data packet is a small unit of data formatted for internet transfer, acting like a digital envelope that carries bits of information from one point to another. This concept is crucial in understanding how data travels over the internet, as it ensures efficient and reliable communication across networks by breaking down larger files into more manageable pieces. Each packet contains not only the data being transmitted but also metadata such as the source and destination IP addresses, sequence numbers, and other routing information.

# What is HTTP ? 
- HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is an application-layer protocol that enables web browsers and servers to communicate and share information over the internet .

- HTTP operates as a request-response protocol, where a client, such as a web browser, sends a request to a server, and the server responds with the requested data. This protocol supports various operations, including fetching web pages, images, videos, and posting content to servers.

- Basically request is just like a message that client/frontend(commonly browser) send to backend.
- In JavaScript we can use `XMLHttpRequest`  class to creates a new HTTP message or request object. This object is used to make requests to servers(backend or we can say API) and retrieve(get) data or post data , patch , etc..., from that server.   
**XMLHttpRequest** , is explained in another file , `xmlHttpRequest.md` in JavaScript folder .
