    <h1>Detailed Explanation of JavaScript Promises</h1>
    <p>A <strong>Promise</strong> in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in a more manageable way compared to traditional callback-based approaches.</p>

    <h2>States of a Promise</h2>
    <p>A Promise can be in one of the following states:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pending:</strong> The initial state of a Promise. The operation has not completed yet.</li>
        <li><strong>Fulfilled (Resolved):</strong> The operation completed successfully, and the Promise has a resulting value.</li>
        <li><strong>Rejected:</strong> The operation failed, and the Promise has a reason for the failure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Creating a Promise</h2>
    <p>A Promise is created using the <code>Promise</code> constructor, which takes a function (called the executor) as an argument. This function has two parameters: <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code>, which are functions themselves.</p>
    <pre>
       <strong> // Basically the code of `then` blocks will only executed if promise resolved(Basically , if that promise callback , calls a function in that is in first parameter) 
        , otherwise if its callback call reject(function in its 2nd param) `then` blocks code will not be executed and that promise will throw error , and that error can be catched using catch method of promise or try and catch block
        there is also a third possibility if its callback neither call reject nor resolve then that promise will be settled to pending state and code in `then` or `catch` blocks 
    of that promise , will never be executed </strong>
        
        const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            // Asynchronous operation
            let success = true;
            if (success) {
                resolve("Promise Resolved Successfully!");
            } else {
                reject("Promise Rejected!");
            }
        });
    </pre>
    <p>In this example, the Promise is resolved if <code>success</code> is <code>true</code>, otherwise it is rejected.</p>

    <h2>Handling Promises with <code>then()</code> and <code>catch()</code></h2>
    <p>Once a Promise is created, you can handle its result using the <code>then()</code> method for success and the <code>catch()</code> method for errors.</p>
    <pre>
        // and we can make chain of `then` , example: <code>.then((res)=>{return `${res} from first then`}).then((return_val_of_1st_then)=>{console.log(return_val_of_1st_then)}) ... </code> , that will execute in order , 
        myPromise.then(result => {
            console.log("Success:", result);
        }).catch(error => {
            console.log("Error:", error);
        });
    </pre>
    <p>In this example, if the Promise is resolved, the <code>then()</code> method is called with the result. If the Promise is rejected, the <code>catch()</code> method is called with the error.</p>

    <h2>Promise Methods</h2>
    <h3>Promise.all()</h3>
    <p>The <code>Promise.all()</code> method takes an array of Promises and returns a single Promise that resolves when all of the Promises in the array have resolved. If any Promise in the array is rejected, the entire <code>Promise.all()</code> is rejected.</p>
    <pre>
        const promise1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve("First Done"), 1000));
        const promise2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve("Second Done"), 2000));
        
        Promise.all([promise1, promise2]).then(results => {
            console.log("Promise.all results:", results);
        }).catch(error => {
            console.log("Promise.all error:", error);
        });
    </pre>
    <p>In this example, <code>Promise.all()</code> waits for both <code>promise1</code> and <code>promise2</code> to resolve. Once both are resolved, the <code>then()</code> method is called with an array of results.</p>

    <h3>Promise.race()</h3>
    <p>The <code>Promise.race()</code> method takes an array of Promises and returns a single Promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the Promises in the array resolves or rejects.And in case of resolve , the promise which resolves first that resolve value is taken as resolve value of <code>Promise.race()</code> and comes in callback first parameter of <code>Promise.race().then()</code> method
        , instead of array of results of all promises resolve values like <code>Promise.all()</code> , and its obvious to think
    how it can give us resolve values of all promises if it suddenly resolves by any one of them , and other promises are still in pending state</p>
    <pre>
        Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(result => {
            console.log("Promise.race result:", result);
        }).catch(error => {
            console.log("Promise.race error:", error);
        });
    </pre>
    <p>In this example, <code>Promise.race()</code> will resolve or reject as soon as either <code>promise1</code> or <code>promise2</code> resolves or rejects. The result will be the value of the first Promise to settle.</p>

    <h3>Promise.allSettled()</h3>
    <p>The <code>Promise.allSettled()</code> method takes an array of Promises and returns a single Promise that resolves when all of the Promises in the array have settled (either resolved or rejected). The result is an array of objects that describe the outcome of each Promise.</p>
    <pre>
        const promise3 = new Promise((_, reject) => setTimeout(() => reject("Third Failed"), 1500));
        
        Promise.allSettled([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then(results => {
            console.log("Promise.allSettled results:", results);
        });
    </pre>
    <p>In this example, <code>Promise.allSettled()</code> waits for all Promises to settle, regardless of whether they resolve or reject. The result is an array of objects with <code>status</code> and <code>value</code> or <code>reason</code> properties.</p>

    <h3>Promise.any()</h3>
    <p>The <code>Promise.any()</code> method takes an array of Promises and returns a single Promise that resolves as soon as any of the Promises in the array fulfills. If all Promises are rejected, the returned Promise is rejected with an <code>AggregateError</code>.</p>
    <pre>
        const promise4 = new Promise((_, reject) => setTimeout(() => reject("Fourth Failed"), 500));
        
        Promise.any([promise3, promise4, promise1]).then(result => {
            console.log("Promise.any result:", result);
        }).catch(error => {
            console.log("Promise.any error:", error);
        });
    </pre>
    <p>In this example, <code>Promise.any()</code> will resolve as soon as any of the Promises fulfills. If all Promises are rejected, the <code>catch()</code> method is called with an <code>AggregateError</code>.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Promises are a powerful feature in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations. They provide a cleaner and more manageable way to work with asynchronous code compared to traditional callbacks. By understanding the different states of a Promise and the various methods available (<code>then()</code>, <code>catch()</code>, <code>Promise.all()</code>, <code>Promise.race()</code>, <code>Promise.allSettled()</code>, and <code>Promise.any()</code>), you can write more efficient and readable asynchronous code.</p>
