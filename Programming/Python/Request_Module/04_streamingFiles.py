"""
This script downloads a file from a given URL while displaying a progress bar using tqdm.
It streams the file in chunks instead of downloading it all at once, reducing memory usage.
Streaming means that the file is downloaded in pieces, which is helpful if you're downloading large files. 

Key Concepts Covered:
- Streaming file downloads with requests
- Using `tqdm` for a progress bar
- Understanding `response.iter_content()`

Explanation of tqdm parameters used:
1. desc: Displays the filename before the progress bar.
2. total: The total size of the file, so tqdm can calculate percentage.
3. unit: Specifies the unit (B = bytes) for readability.
4. unit_scale: Converts bytes to KB, MB, GB automatically.
5. unit_divisor: Uses 1024 as the base to convert bytes to KB/MB/GB (instead of 1000).

---- How They Work Together in tqdm ----
# Let's take an example of a 5MB file (5,242,880 bytes).
# 
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Default Case (unit='B', unit_scale=False, unit_divisor=1024)
# tqdm(total=5242880, unit='B', unit_scale=False, unit_divisor=1024)
# üìå Output:
# 0%|          | 0/5242880B [00:00<?, ?B/s]
# - Shows raw bytes (B) as progress.
# - No conversion happens (unit_scale=False).
# 
# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Enable Unit Scaling (unit='B', unit_scale=True, unit_divisor=1024)
# tqdm(total=5242880, unit='B', unit_scale=True, unit_divisor=1024)
# üìå Output:
# 0%|          | 0/5.0MB [00:00<?, ?MB/s]
# - Now the size is converted to MB (5MB).
# - The B (bytes) unit is auto-converted to KB/MB/GB.
# 
# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Use Metric Divisor (unit='B', unit_scale=True, unit_divisor=1000)
# tqdm(total=5242880, unit='B', unit_scale=True, unit_divisor=1000)
# üìå Output:
# 0%|          | 0/5.2MB [00:00<?, ?MB/s]
# - Now 5,242,880 bytes = 5.2MB, because 1KB = 1000B (metric system).
# 
# üöÄ Key Takeaways
# unit ‚Üí Just a label (doesn‚Äôt affect calculations).
# unit_scale=True ‚Üí Converts bytes to KB/MB/GB automatically for readability.
# unit_divisor=1024 ‚Üí Uses binary standard (1KB = 1024B).
# unit_divisor=1000 ‚Üí Uses metric standard (1KB = 1000B).

How `requests.get(url, stream=True)` and `response.iter_content()` Work Together

1. `requests.get(url, stream=True)` is called
   - This sends a request to the server.
   - Unlike `stream=False`, it **does not download the full response body immediately**.
   - Instead, it **only downloads the response headers** (like `content-length`, status, etc.).
   - The actual file content is **not yet received** in full.

2. `response.iter_content(chunk_size=1024)` starts iterating
   - This **fetches the first chunk (1024 bytes)** from the server.
   - The first chunk is **processed and written to the file immediately**.
   - Then, it **requests the next chunk**, processes it, writes it, and repeats until the file is fully downloaded.

‚úÖ Key Understanding
- `requests.get(url, stream=True)` **does NOT fetch even the first chunk immediately**.  
- It just **opens the connection** and **waits** until you start iterating over `iter_content()`.  
- `response.iter_content(chunk_size=1024)` then **controls the fetching process**, one chunk at a time.

‚ùå Incorrect Understanding
> *"`requests.get(url, stream=True)` fetches the first chunk, and then `iter_content()` fetches the rest."*  
**Wrong!** `requests.get(url, stream=True)` does **not fetch any part of the file until** `iter_content()` is called.

üéØ Correct Analogy
Imagine downloading a book:
- **`requests.get(url, stream=True)`** = Opening the book cover (but not reading yet).
- **`response.iter_content(chunk_size=1024)`** = Reading one page at a time (downloading each page when needed).

This approach is useful for downloading large files efficiently.
